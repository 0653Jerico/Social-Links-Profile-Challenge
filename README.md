## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned a lot during this retake on the challenge and took me some time to get the design that somehow copies the original using new properties learned. I understood a little bit the use of clamp() in CSS.

### Continued development

I will continue using the most common used properties and the advanced properties soon as I go up higher.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://www.fonts.google.com) - Still using this website to get my fonts, it is easy and contains a lot of fonts.
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I still rely on this website since it provides simplified explanations with examples.
- [Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - Search over the internet for some solutions to my problems and found it here, it was a big help.
-[ChatGpt](https:/chat.openai.com) - I used the AI chat to help assisst me in understanding the concepts that I am having difficulty understanding.
